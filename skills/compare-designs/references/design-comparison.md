# Design comparison

Templates for running a comparison. Fill them in; do not ship the blank forms.

## Candidate brief

The one brief every candidate receives. Keep it identical across candidates.

- Artifact: what each candidate must produce, and the final form (type sketch, module map, prose rationale, working prototype).
- Constraints: the existing types to interoperate with, callers that cannot break, invariants that cross the boundary, and the allowed mutation level.
- Caller's usage: what the consumer imports, calls, and receives. This is the spec.
- Allowed workspaces: where each candidate writes, so candidates cannot collide.
- Required rationale: each candidate names the alternatives it considered and what it rejected, in a few lines.

Candidates do not see the rubric, so they produce their own best shape rather than optimizing to the grader.

## Rubric

Turn what success means for this task into 3 to 6 criteria a judge can score. Each criterion is concrete and gradeable, not a restatement of "good design".

Examples of criteria shapes:

- Interface depth: complexity hidden behind the public surface versus the size of that surface.
- Correctness under the stated invariants.
- Failure and concurrency behavior.
- Migration cost and backward compatibility.
- Fit with existing ownership and layering.
- Verification cost.

## Judge brief

Give the judge the rubric and the candidates by label only. Ask it to score each criterion for each candidate, then recommend a base and say why. The judge does not rewrite candidates and does not pick on overall feel.

## Synthesis record

Ship this alongside the chosen artifact.

- Base: which candidate, and the reason.
- Judge verdict: the scores and the recommendation, and whether they agreed with the pick.
- Grafts: what was folded in, from which candidate, and why it strengthens the base.
- Rejections: what was left out, and why.
- Dropouts: any candidate that failed to produce output.
- Convergence: if candidates agreed, note it; if they diverged widely, note the reframe.
- Verification: how the synthesized artifact was proven, and at what evidence level.
